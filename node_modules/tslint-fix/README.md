# tslint-fix

## Usage
```
npm install -g tslint-fix
tslint -c tslint.json src/**/*.ts > tslintout.txt
tslint-fix tslintout.txt
```

## NOTE:
[tslint 4.0](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/2016/11/17/new-for-4.0.html) now includes a `tslint --fix` option so this package may be the latest and greatest.

Use `tslint-fix` as you see fit. It helped me solve my problems, may be it can help solve yours too!

Its a simple one file, ~200 line js file package. Viewing the source is very much encouraged.
